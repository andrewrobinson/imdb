1) You have to Ctrl-C or wait for a timeout to see the resulst.
See tyrone-finished-processing branch for an attempt at solving this

2) Not sure how to integrate my real code with this.

2) I can't seem to send to channels from inside a case statement.
This is why Tyrone's shutdownSigTerm <- syscall.SIGTERM doesn't work?
and why I have to hack a break L

3) case result := <-resultsPipe fires in an infinite loop if resultsPipe is closed. Why? all other signals are drowned out
